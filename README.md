# WiFi Map
Makes data generated by wigle android app searchable (with filters) and overlays it on google maps.

###About

I wanted to see the networks in my neighbourhood, but found the global map on wigle.net to be far from detailed enough. With this you can take the data generated by the wigle app, and overlay it on google maps. You also get filtering options based on encryption, SSID, BSSID, date seen and more.
It is also possible to import data generated by airodump-ng on linux, connect it with the data from wigle, and potentially see which clients that have probed or been connected to networks in your database.
